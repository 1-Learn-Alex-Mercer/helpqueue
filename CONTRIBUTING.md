Contributing to HelpLIFO
=====================

Thank you for using HelpLIFO, and we're really excited that you want to help out!

Right now the code base is still not docstringed out yet so fun!

Pull Requests
-------------

We actively welcome your pull requests!

However, before you begin, please create an issue so we can determine if the work, feature, or bugfix either has someone already working on it as a part of the current roadmap, or if the feature is not something that would belong in the HELPq as a core feature.

This is mostly meant for discussion, so we can discuss things fully and make a really awesome product :)

Issues
------

We use issues to track public bugs. Please make sure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

We also use issues to track feature requests and discuss. Please mark your issue as 'Feature Request' in this case!


Coding Style
------------

Keep it clean, and keep things modular!
